# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)

One Paragraph of project description goes here
This project show how to implement the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to maximize a function. All code are write in Python 3.x and Jupyter Notebook.

## Getting Started

All you need for running this project is [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html). It's also necessary to have the [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) library installed in your Python 3.x distribution.


### Prerequisites

Installing Python3.x:

```
apt-get install python3.x
```

Installing Jupyter Notebook with pip:

```
python3.x -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3.x -m pip install jupyter
```

Installing the NumPy library with pip:

```
python3.x -m pip install numpy
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

[Genetic Algorithm - Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/christianrfg/ga_pso/blob/master/Genetic%20Algorithm%20-%20Particle%20Swarm%20Optimization%20.ipynb) -  Notebook with the description and execution of the PSO method to maximize one specifc function.
